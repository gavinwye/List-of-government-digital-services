      <p>
        There have been many attempts to create a list of services. This is an attempt to bring all of these lists together in one place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once we know where all of the servcies are we can work together in a more joined up way.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body-l"><a class="govuk-button" href="/list">View the register</a></p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Data sources</h2>
      <p>The data in this list comes from a veriety of <a href="/data-sources">sources</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contributing</h2>

      <p>This is an open croud-sorced effort. If your service isn't on the list you can contribute it. </p>

      <p>We'll maintain a record of who contributed the service but won't publish this information. </p>

      <p>You need three peices of information:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>The service name</li>
        <li>The URL of the service</li>
        <li>The department that's respobnsible for the service </li>
      </ul>



      <p>Only services with a pingable URL will be included in the list.</p>
